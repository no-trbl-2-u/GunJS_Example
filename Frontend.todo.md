# Frontend TODO

## SETUP

- Configure Typescript
- Configure import aliases (ie. components/_ vs. ../../../components/_)
- Configure a workaround for the styles in index.html

## Implement Internal Routing (DONE)

~- Will need a "content" area since Nav is in center of the screen~
~- Potentially expand Nav to take up width/height 100% so it can animate to fill the page?~

## Implement some type of base global Nav or "Return Home" button

- Do it

## Implement Login/Logout UI

- Buttons in Header
- Default to Login page (maybe?)

## Map Out UI for Stock Exchange

- Implement API call to get current Stock/Bitcoin values
  - Potentially open a socket or GUN to get up-to-date values
  - Each stock profile should have their own live, anon chat to discuss stock

# Potential future ideas

## Theming

- Implement Dark/Light mode via ThemeProvider
